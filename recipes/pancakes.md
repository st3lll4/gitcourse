# Classic Pancakes

## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 1/4 cups milk
- 1 egg
- 3 tablespoons butter, melted

## Instructions
1. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.
2. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.
3. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.
4. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake.
5. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, about 1-2 minutes.
6. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 1-2 minutes more.
7. Serve hot with maple syrup, fresh fruit, or your favorite toppings.

## Notes
- For fluffier pancakes, let the batter rest for 5 minutes before cooking.
- Makes about 8-10 pancakes.
