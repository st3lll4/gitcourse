# Greek Yogurt Pancakes

## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 cup plain Greek yogurt
- 1/2 cup milk
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar.
2. In a separate bowl, mix together the Greek yogurt, milk, eggs, oil, and vanilla extract until well combined.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined (do not overmix - a few lumps are okay).
4. Let the batter rest for 5-10 minutes to allow the baking powder to activate.
5. Heat a lightly greased griddle or frying pan over medium heat.
6. Pour approximately 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake.
7. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.
8. Flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 1-2 minutes more.
9. Serve warm with honey, fresh berries, or maple syrup.

## Notes
- Greek yogurt makes these pancakes extra moist and tender.
- The batter will be slightly thicker than regular pancake batter due to the Greek yogurt.
- For extra protein, you can use Greek yogurt with higher fat content.
- Makes about 10-12 pancakes.
- These pancakes freeze well - just reheat in a toaster or microwave.
